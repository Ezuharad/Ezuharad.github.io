# Portfolio Website
At a surface level, this project isn't much more than a portfolio website for myself and my research. However, I decided to set myself the limitation of not using any JavaScript or WebAssembly, meaning that the entire website is written in just HTML and CSS. So far I'm pretty proud of the project, but I'm hoping to expand it to include responsive layouts.
